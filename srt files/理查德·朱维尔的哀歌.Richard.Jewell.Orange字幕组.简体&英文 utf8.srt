74

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,330
- 怎么了 - 你钱够用吗
- What? - You got enough money?

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,500
应该够吧 怎么了
Yeah, I guess so. Why do you... why do you ask?

96
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,330
这代表着 来而不往非礼也
This comes with a quid pro quo.

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,030
你知道是什么意思吗
You know what that is?

98
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,340

相当公平 我们来做个交易

You got me?

105
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,420
当然 先生 我不会变成坏人
No, sir, I won't become an asshole.

106
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,190
人一旦拥有哪怕一点权利
A little power can turn a person

107
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,760
都可能变成魔鬼 理查德
Into a monster, Richard.

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
别做那种人
Don't do that.

109

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,870
还给你的 先生
The first paycheck I get, sir.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,240
连同利息
I'm gonna pay you back

114
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,270
一起还给你
with interest.

115
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,240

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
谢谢您 布莱恩特先生
Thank you, Mr. Bryant.

00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,450
她说她玩足球
She said that she played soccer.

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,610
我当时就说
So I was like,

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,240
怎么 你想看看我怎么用脚
"You wanna see me, what, balance

120
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,060
让一瓶啤酒保持平衡吗
A frickin' beer on my foot?"

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,520
老天 你这白痴
God, you dumb-ass.

122
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,190
我只是慌了 快去开门
I got flustered. Get the door.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,620
等等
Wait.

124
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,090
反应挺快 小伙子
Nice try, hotshot.

125
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,260
是那个菜鸟警察
It's that rent-a-cop.

126
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,290
妈的
Shit.

127
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,230
开门吧 给他开门
Open the door. Open the door.

128
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,100
有事吗 警官
Yes, officer?

129
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,470
有人投诉这里噪音太大
I heard a little noise complaint.

130
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
我来看看什么情况
Thought I'd come take a look around.

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,370
你得先有搜查令
You're gonna need a search warrant first.

132
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,950
小伙子 把你的手拿开
Son, you're gonna have to take your hands off me.

133
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,370
我只是看看而已
I'm just takin' a little look-see.

134
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,190
首先 你都算不上真正的警察
Well, you're not even a real cop, first of all,

135
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,410
而且你不能没有搜查令
And you're not allowed

136
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,510
就进别人的房间
to search a room without a warrant.

137
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,050
- 小伙子 - 我们付了房租的
- Boy! - We pay rent. We pay rent.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,190
所以这是我们的地方 老兄
It's like we live here, man.

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,920
孩子 这是我的职责
Boy, this is my job.

140
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,530
你必须配合我的工作 小伙子
I'm gonna have to have you let me do my job, curlicue.

141
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,050
可这是我们的房间
And this is our room.

142
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,560
没错
Yeah.

143
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,190
你知道有个概念叫
Are you aware of the notion

144
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,190
非法搜查和扣押吗
of unlawful search and seizure?

145
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,170
混蛋 你不能就这样走进别人的房间
Asshole, you're not supposed to just walk in here.

146
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,260
你就推我 试探我的底线吧
Keep pushin' me. Keep testin' me.

147
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,370
看你喜不喜欢这带来的后果
See if you like where it gets you.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
是吗
Yeah?

149
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,870
你没事吧
You all right?

150
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,310
我在新生入学周是怎么说的
What did I say freshman orientation week?

151
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,310
我说 校园内不许喝酒
I said, "no drinkin' on my campus."

152
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,210
我不知道为什么之前没人提醒我
I don't know why no one called my attention

153
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,550
留意你的档案
to your file before.

154
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,080
有很多人投诉你的工作
I mean, all these complaints about you.

155
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,020
殴打学生
Physically assaulting a student.

156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,300
还有 你真的有在公路上
And have you really been pulling people over

157
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,960
把别人的车拦下吗
on the highway?

158
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,960
呃 是的先生
Um... yes, sir, I have.

159
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,970
我只是觉得在路上检查醉驾
I figured that if you do the drunk tests on the road,

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,070
校园内会安全很多
trouble never gets to the campus.

161
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,640
公路不在我们的管辖范围之内
We don't have any jurisdiction on the highway.

162
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,510
我明白 但
And I realize that,

163
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,340
我信仰法律和秩序 先生
but I believe in law and order, sir.

164
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,440
一个国家不能没有法律和秩序
You can't have a country without it.

165
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,050
嗯 你被哈伯沙姆县
Hmm. and you were dismissed

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,420
治安办公室解雇了
From the Habersham county sheriff's office.

167
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,180
我不希望这里有任何
"I don't want any mickey-mousin'

168
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,350
对工作敷衍了事的人
on these grounds."

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,220
这不是你说过的话吗
Isn't that what you said?

170
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,990
我什么时候说过
When did I say that?

171
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,160
去年校庆的时候 我记得
You said it at founders' day last year, I believe.

172
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,560
您当时在供应酒水的地方
You were by the punch bowl.

173
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,330
我走向你 然后你对我说
I walked up to you, and you said to me...

174
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
嗯 呃
Uh, uh...

175
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,200
我当时打断了您的讲话
Well, I had interrupted you.

176
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,200
我道歉后 开始向你介绍自己
I apologized, I introduced myself,

177
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,610
我说 我会成为你手下
And I said I was gonna be the greatest

178
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,400
最尽责的校园保安
Campus security guard you ever had.

179
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,410
然后你说 很好
And you said, "that's good."

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,580
我不希望这个校园里
"I don't want any mickey-mousin'

181
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,980
有任何敷衍了事的人
on this campus."

182
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,350
我好像还把它写下来了
I think I might've even wrote it down.

183
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,350
我会记录很多东西
I write down most things.

184
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,120
把重要的都记下来
I keep the important ones.

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
我记得 噢 在这里
And I believe... oh, yes, sir.

186
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,230
我不希望这个校园里
"I don't want any mickey-mousin'

187
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,660
有任何敷衍了事的人
on these grounds."

188
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,030
这是你曾说过的话 先生
Those are your words, sir.

189
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,370
我把它看得很重要
So, I took it seriously,

190
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,270
现在我想问您的是
And now, my question for you is,

191
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,710
那些住校的孩子们
What about these kids in the dormitory,

192
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,610
喝酒 还做其他事
drinkin' and all that?

193
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,410
您打算采取什么措施吗 还是就这样算了
What you gonna do about that? We're just gonna let it slide?

194
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,150
你想自己辞职
Do you wanna resign,

195
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,020
还是我把你炒掉
or would it be better if I fired you?

196
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,320
接着我走进那家伙的办公室
So, I'm goin' into this guy's office

197
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,190
想着他把我叫过来
and I think that he's bringing me in there,

198
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,160
是要表扬我的工作 你懂的
'cause he's gonna, you know, give me some commendation

199
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,760
或者升职什么的
or a promotion or something.

200
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,660
结果发现是为了炒我鱿鱼
Come to find out he brought me in there to fire me.

201
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,500
你能相信吗
Can you believe that?

202
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,630
反正都是些烂工作
Well, it was a shit job, anyway.

203
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,070
学校里那帮兔崽子
Hasslin' college brats.

204
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
而且还会有很多安保工作的
Besides, there's gonna be so much security work

205
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,640
过几个月 你会找到新工作的
The next couple months, you're set.

206
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,580
是吧 我工作很努力的
Yeah, well, I worked hard at that job.

207
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,180
只是那帮孩子太顽皮了
Those kids were just runnin' wild.

208
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,380
奥运会马上要开始了 哥们
Olympics are coming, brother.

209
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,380
你可以保卫这该死的整个世界
You can police the whole damn world.

210
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,490
在世纪公园举办庆典
Celebrations at centennial park.

211
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,120
- 噢 - 这该死的城市
- oh. - something finally happens

212
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,520
终于有正经事可做了
In this stupid city

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,070
我却要去什么狗屁肯尼 罗杰斯演唱会
And I get a fucking Kenny Rogers concert.

214
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,330
已经算好了 总好过马术比赛
It could be worse. Could be equestrian.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,590
我还要做丰胸手术
I'm getting my tits done.

216
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,130
我看不出这两者有什么联系
I don't see how that applies here.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,210
明年这个时候 我们都会在电视上
This time next year, we're all gonna be

218
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,200
求着别人给我们工作做
scrambling for jobs on TV.

219
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,830
升到D杯 怎么样
What do you think, D cup?

220
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,700
我会想你的 凯西 但我想他们不会
Well, I'd miss you, Kathy, but, I don't think they would.

221
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,280
小姐们 很抱歉我超有料的谋杀报道
Ladies, I'm sorry my hot-ass murders

222
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,510
把你们那些无聊的废话从头版上挤下来
keep knocking your boring bullshit off the front page.

223
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,310
真不好意思呢
I'm so sorry.

224
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,480
你想喝一杯吗
You wanna get a drink?

225
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,680
我会拖你后腿的
I'd just slow you down.

226
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,450
随你便
Suit yourself.

227
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
没问题 如果你觉得这样最好的话
Yeah, if you think that's the best thing.

228
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,090
很好
Great.

229
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,200
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

230
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,830
我要去世纪公园了
I get to go to centennial park.

231
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,340
沃森
Watson.

232
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,410
怎么
Yeah.

233
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,480
我们没有碳粉和复印纸了
We're out of toner and copy paper.

234
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,420
呃
Um...

235
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,420
然后呢
Okay.

236
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,320
我去买的话 你就得接这里的电话
If I go, you'll have to answer the phones.

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,630
不 我去
No, I'll go.

238
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,430
商场在大减价 打九折
There's a sale at the mall. It's 10% off,

239
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,230
但得说出一个美国奥运队里的名字
if you name anyone from the U.S. Olympic team.

240
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,530
噢 乐到不行
Oh, joy.

241
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,540
我知道 人们要连着笑十六天
I know. People smiling for 16 days.

242
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,270
你应该觉得很难受
It's going to be awful for you.

243
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,570
不 对有线新闻网和可口可乐
No, it's gonna be wonderful for CNN,

244
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,710
还有那些有钱佬来说 应该爽翻了
coca-cola, and anybody with a parking lot.

245
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,890
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

246
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,460
这一天真的来了
It's really here.

247
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,290
是啊 妈妈
Yeah, this is it, mama.

248
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
要是我在奥运会上表现好了
I do this Olympics gig well

249
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,800
说不定又能做回警察
Maybe someone might make me a cop again.

250
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,630
再过几天 他会努力成为
He, in a few days will try

251
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,310
第一个赢得奥运金牌的人
to become the first man to ever win Olympic gold...

252
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,840
是啊 尽你所能就好了
Yeah, you just do the best you can.

253
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,370
嘿 我应该会在你
Hey, I might not move out

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,650
做完手术后才搬出去
Until after you've had your surgery.

255
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,210
我也许能帮上什么
You might need me for something.

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,770
- 你觉得呢 - 噢
- What do you think? - Oh...

257
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,310
你先去上班吧
You go on now.

258
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,550
奥运会结束后
We got plenty of time to tend to that

259
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,610
有的是时间处理这件事
After the games are over.

260
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,550
别开车太快
No heavy foot of yours drivin' there.

261
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,680
慢慢来
No heavy foot.

262
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,420
慢点开车 好的妈妈
No heavy foot. Yes, ma'am.

263
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,850
为什么呢
And why is that?

264
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,590
因为你要等到保险额增加 才能让我出事
Because you'll kill me if the insurance goes up?

265
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,190
没错 到那时我就得杀了你
That's right. I'd have to kill you.

266
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,290
你得杀了我
You'd have to kill me.

267
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,530
嘿 呃
Hey, uh...

268
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,910
尽管我只负责看管
It's still law enforcement, ain't it?

269
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,870
看管一些音响设备 架子什么的
Even if I'm just watching over

270
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,840
我还是在执行法务 对吗
A bunch of stereo equipment and whatnot?

271
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,780
废话 当然是
Heck yeah.

272
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,240
你一直都是个好人
You're still the good guy

273
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,210
对抗那些坏人 不是吗
Wardin' off the bad guys, aren't ya?

274
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,420
回头见 妈妈
I'll see you later, mother.

275
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,000
去公园转转吧 你在家会无聊死的
Come on down to the park you get bored with yourself.

276

00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,910
从这场爆炸中救出的人

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,590
- 我知道 - 我无法想象你去了会发生什么

妈妈 我真不知道怎么说

昨晚真的是一团乱
It was complete chaos, mama.

743
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,940
我昨天差点就请了病假
And to think I could've called in sick.

我昨天的状态应该要请假的

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,730
现场的眼线并不多 我们也有责任
We didn't have enough eyeballs there. That's on us.

754

当务之急还是抓住那个放炸弹的疯子吧

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,450
提出你对理查德 朱维尔犯罪行为的指控
regarding your suspicions about Richard Jewell.

767
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,090
我先澄清一下
I wanna be clear,

768
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,150
我没有指控他犯罪
I haven't accused him of anything.

769
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,490
我们明白
We completely understand.

770
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,320
我只是
I just...

771
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,100
他现在家喻户晓
I see the attention he's getting.

772
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,860
这种关注度是他一直以来梦寐以求的
It's the kind of attention he was always seeking here.

773
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,500
但他其实有不为人知的阴暗面
Harassing students, pulling people over on the highway.

774
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,870
骚扰学生 在高速公路上随意拦车
Just crazy behavior.

775
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,010
如果我的直觉没有错
And I decided if my fears were correct,

776
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,310
他其实并不是人人称颂的英雄
If he actually wasn't the hero they're making him out to be,

777
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,280
关于他的恶劣行径我有确凿的证据
and I had information pertinent to the fact

778
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,180
却一直没有公之于众
which I failed to bring to light...

779
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,950
现在贸然公布会有生命危险
It could jeopardize lives.

780
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,420
我们明白了 您选择联系我们是正确的
Well, Dr. Cleere, you did the right thing in calling us.

781
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,120
请放心 我们会继续跟进
We will, rest assured, follow up on this.

782
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,520
您介意我们带走这份文件吗
Do you mind if we take this folder with us?

783
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:00,860
请便
Please.

784
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,260
我们复印一份之后 会把原件还给您
We'll make a copy and get you the original back.

785
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,960
该死的ACOG为什么重新开放公园
Why is the goddamn ACOG reopening that park?

786
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,330
不然我们哪来这么多破事
We don't have shit!

787
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,140
言归正传 我现在想听更多朱维尔的信息
Okay, I wanna hear more about Jewell.

788
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,270
帕特里克你来说
Patrick?

789
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,510
当我着手调查这个案子的时候
Well, when I look at Jewell...

790
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,950
我联想到了1984年洛杉矶奥林匹克现场的炸弹恐慌
I think about the bomb scare at the L.A. Olympics in '84.

791
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,880
一个警察将炸弹放在巴士上后
A bag left on a bus by the same cop

792
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,150
又假装发现了它
who then discovered it.

793
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,450
今年夏天在爱达荷的一场火灾
And the fires in Idaho this summer,

794
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,320
同样是因一个消防员而起
started by a firefighter

795
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,890
他想自导自演 成为救火英雄
who wanted the credit for putting them out.

796
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,390
现在又来了一个
A profile emerges here.

797
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,860
冒牌英雄
The false hero.

798
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,130
采访里
In interviews,

799
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,870
朱维尔对于爆炸的描述含糊其辞
Jewell's account of the bombing seems vague

800
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,430
谈及受害者的时候还有明显的不适
and he looks uncomfortable discussing the victims.

801
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,730
他还在电视采访中说过
I also found that his mentioning on TV

802
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,340
他想回到执法机关工作
that he wanted to get back into law enforcement a bit

803
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,040
十分可疑
inappropriate.

804
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,200
他的身上还有很多疑点
There's a lot here that's troubling.

805
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,180
探员肖目前掌握到的他的信息
And everything that agent Shaw has learned about him,

806
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,880
和这份文件里所写的几乎一致
syncs up with this profile.

807
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,650
是这样吗 汤姆
You agree with that, Tom?

808
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,390
是的 先生
Yes, sir, I do.

809
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,490
盯紧他
Let's put eyes on him.

810
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,970
- 沃森 - 怎么了
- Watson? - Yeah?

811
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
- 沃森 - 有事吗
- Watson? - Yeah.

812
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,340
一号线有你的电话
You have a call on line one.

813
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,240
比尔盖茨又来对我嘘寒问暖了吗
Is it Bill Gates randomly wondering

814
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,970
问我需不需要一百万美元
If I need a million dollars?

815
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,150
那我肯定需要
If so, that's an affirmative.

816
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,340
是理查德 朱维尔
It's Richard Jewell.

817
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,500
哪个理查德 朱维尔 是我知道的那个吗
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell?

818
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,980
就是那个 接一号线
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell, line one.

819
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,060
- 喂 - 布莱恩特先生 您好
- Hello? - Mr. Bryant.

820
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,590
很抱歉打扰您
Hey, uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

821
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,690
我从查号台找到了你的号码
I just got your number from information.

822
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,560
希望您还记得我
I hope you remember me.

823
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,300
别见外 叫我沃森就好了 你现在可是个国民英雄啊
Radar, you can call me Watson. You're a national hero now.

824
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,600
很高兴你能打来 家里的士力架快吃完了
I'm glad you called. We're running out of snickers.

825
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,000
谢谢您
Thank you, sir.

826
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,070
您最近怎么样 家里还好吗
How are you? How's your family?

827
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,610
我们都很好
We're all fine, yeah.

828
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,240
你现在可是今非昔比了
I see you've moved up from video games.

829
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,050
是的 我无意如此 但我想事实已经这样了
Yep, I didn't mean to, but I guess I did.

830
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,280
干得漂亮 真为你感到高兴
Good job. That's a prideful thing.

831
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,650
我能为你做些什么
What can I do you for?

832
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,390
先生 我打电话来
Oh, sir, I was calling you

833
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,700
因为我想知道
Because I wanted to know,

834
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,390
你出过书吗
Have you ever done a book deal?

835
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,730
怎么
Why?

836
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,270
爆炸之后 有些纽约的朋友
With this whole bomb thing, I got these New York guys

837
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,160
叫我写本书
who are asking me to write a book

838
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,620
我对此一窍不通
and I don't really know anything about that,

839
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,700
所以想打给你试试
so I thought maybe I could call you,

840
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,640
你说不定可以帮我
You might be able to help me.

841
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
当然 听起来有点牵强
Sure. sounds a little far-fetched,

842
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,920
不过 合同就是合同 但 我们可以谈谈
But contracts are contracts, but I yeah, I, we could talk.

843
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,720
所以你不是
So, are you not

844
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
美国小型企业管理局的了是吧
The U.S. Small Business Admin anymore?

845
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,920
我之前打过电话
'cause I tried there first.

846
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,050
不是了 我跳槽了
No, I moved on.

847
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,740
哇 怎么回事
Oh. How come?

848
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,490
生活所迫
Lifestyle decision.

849
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,180
你电话多少
What's your phone number?

850
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,300
- 我电话是 404 - 404
- My phone number is 404... - 404...

851

853
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,170
好的 你先不要签字啥的
All right, well, you just don't sign anything

854
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,300
等我先看一眼 就从这开始吧
until I see it first. We'll start there.

855
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,220
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

856
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,740
好 我不会签的 我先等着
Yeah, I won't put a pen to the page. I'll wait on it.

857
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,040
谢谢你 谢谢你抽空
Hey, and thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.

858
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,020
搞定
You got it.

859
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,180
好 拜拜
All right, bye.

860
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,110
- 保持联系 - 好的 先生
- Stay in touch. - Yes, sir.

861
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,050
- 好 - 拜拜
- Okay. - Bye.

862
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,520
别 别
No, no.

863
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,600
别太高兴
Don't get too excited.

864
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,300
- 不会吧 - 没错
- No. - Yes.

865
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,000
别 炖一下 加辣椒酱
No. Simmer down there. Hot Sauce.

866
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,430
嗨 比尔·米勒
Well, Bill Miller.

867
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,260
见到你真好 好久不见了
It's nice to see you. It's been a while.

868
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,610
很高兴见到你 波比
It's nice to see you, Bobi.

869
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,100
我们的英雄呢
Where's the hero?

870
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,380
他在家呢 进来吧
Oh, he's in here. Come on in.

871
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,380
你觉得是哪种电池
What kind of charge you figure it was?

872
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
我不确定他用的什么炸弹
I'm not sure what kinda explosive the guy used.

873
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,530
可能是黑火药 火柴头
It could have been black powder, match heads,

874
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,730
也可能是某种氯酸盐里塞了钉子
Maybe some kinda chlorate packed with nails.

875
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,080
你知道吗 搞笑的是
You know, the funny thing is

876
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,940
那个炸药包就是会炸的 对吧
The package was supposed to blow out, right?

877
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,070
所以那些醉汉撞倒它
So, when those drunks, those kids knocked it over,

878
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,840
救了不少人命
They saved a bunch of lives.

879
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,280
因为它就是会爆炸
Because it was supposed to blow out

880
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,710
造成巨大的人员伤亡
into a crowd for maximum casualties.

881
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,840
但他们打翻了它 它就向上炸开了
But when they knocked it on its back, it blew upward.

882
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,360
大多数火力都冲着天上
Most of the ordnance going up into the sky.

883
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,780
炸了 所以
It blew up, so...

884
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,440
总之 你看到的是
All in all, what you're looking at

885
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,860
某种电池
is some kind of battery

886
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,580
和某种计时装置
And some kind of timing device,

887
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,320
像钟一样
Like a simple clock.

888
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,400
可能就跟我的腕表一样
Maybe a wristwatch like I'm wearing.

889
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,160
取决于这家伙有多高科技
Depends how high-tech the guy got.

890
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,560
有些家伙
Some of these guys,

891
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,280
尤其是退伍军人
especially if they're ex-military,

892
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,210
或者某个大学的奇才
or they're some kind of whiz outta some university,

893
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,020
他们就会组装
They're gonna use a combination

894
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,760
不同的炸弹
of different bomb tactics.

895
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,860
其他人就照着他们的做
Other people are following it like a recipe.

896
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,610
他们可能
They're probably

897
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,780
- 会弄断手指 - 是的
- losing a finger to it. - Yeah.

898
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,600
取决于讨论的是谁
But depends on who you're talking about

899
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,890
还有谁做的炸弹
And who's making the bomb.

900
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,400
我想听听你的意见
I like getting your opinion on it,

901
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,000
你肯定做了很多研究
And I'm sure you've studied it quite a bit.

902
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,480
谁知道呢
Who knows?

903
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,620
还是关于炸弹袭击者
That's the thing, too, about these bombers.

904
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,900
你我也可能会
It could have been you or me.

905
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,240
他们有些人 看起来就是普通人
These guys, some of them, look like regular people.

906
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,870
大多数都是
Lot of them do.

907
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,560
是啊
Yeah.

908
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,400
你们压力肯定很大
Must be a lot of pressure on you guys.

909
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,860
平时也差不多
No more so than usual.

910
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,800
确实 只是又一个 谢谢
Sure, just another... thank you.

911
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,120
就是奥运会期间
Just your average deadly bombing

912
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,720
美国大地上的寻常致命轰炸
On U.S. soil during the Olympics.

913
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,440
没什么大不了
No big deal.

914
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,280
不知道诶 你们应该也感受到这种狂热
I don't know, you guys must be feeling the heat, too, huh?

915
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,040
有线电视新闻网铺天盖地报道这事
CNN is going wall-to-wall with this.

916
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,590
他们就是干这个的
Is that why we get this outfit?

917
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,640
那给我爆点料吧
So, then give me something I can print.

918
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,380
凯西 你知道我不能这么做
Kathy, you know I can't do that.

919
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,060
没事 我已经打听到
That's all right. I already know

920
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,500
局子在调查某个人
The bureau's looking into somebody.

921
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,200
你怎么知道
Yeah, what makes you think that?

922
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,600
听朋友说的
Friends.

923
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,300
- 朋友 - 线人
- Friends? - Sources.

924
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,240
线人
Sources?

925
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:23,940
在调查谁
Who is it?

926
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,750
凯西 要是他们都不告诉你
Well, Kathy, if you couldn't fuck it out of them,

927
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,810
你为什么觉得我会告诉你
What makes you think you're gonna fuck it outta me?

928
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,140
凯西 你知道我烦什么吗
You know what bothers me, Kathy,

929
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,760
是别人不理解要花多少工夫
Is that people don't understand how much work

930
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,320
才能破一个这样的案子
It costs in making a case like this.

931
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,200
它需要日日夜夜拼命
It's effort 24/7.

932
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,120
你说的对
You're right.

933
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,220
不如你教教我
Why don't you educate me?

934
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,840
这次我不能搞砸了
I will not have this screwed up.

935
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,840
那是一场屠杀
That was a massacre out there.

936
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,540
没有更多人受伤是个奇迹
It's a miracle more people weren't killed.

937
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,030
没有第三方线人证实
I would never go to print without

938
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,380
我是不会报道的
independent corroboration from a second source.

939
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,740
我们的关系也会变得很不一样
And that would put us in a very different zone.

940
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,790
你知道的
As you know.

941
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,240
真的吗
Really?

942
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,740
哪种关系
What kind of zone?

943
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,900
等你去发现
You have to find out.

- 不是吧 - 没错
- No shit? - No shit.

946
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,140
你会盯着发现炸弹的人
You always look at the guy who found the bomb just like

947
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,720
就像你会盯着发现尸体的人
You always look at the guy who found the body.

948
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,320
但这个人他有前科
But this guy, he's got a bad past.

949
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,160
符合炸弹袭击者T的侧写

是
Yeah.

955
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,100
不过得抓紧时间了
This kind of puts a clock on things though.

956
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,650
你想开房还是就在我车里
You wanna get a room or just go to my car?

957
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,980
终于
This is happening.

958
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,940

One of those better word things you do.

963
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,120
你是说帮你改写吗
You mean rewrite you?

964
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,420
是啊 你知道我写得跟屎一样
Yeah, you know I write like a brick,

965
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,110
但这个有点特别
And this one is kinda special.

966
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,640
这是什么
What is it?

967
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,650
没什么 就是

1068
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,260
我猜任何那天晚上在公园的人
Uh, I imagine they'll investigate anyone

1069
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,840
他们都会调查吧
Who was at the park that night.

1070
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,240
也包括你们
That includes all of you, too.

1071
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,640
他们有说你不能出城吗
Have they told you yet you can't leave town?

1072
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,140
没
No.

1073
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,290
- 朱维尔先生 你被捕了吗 - 你是自由身吗
- Mr. Jewell, are you under arrest? - You're free to go wherever you like?

1074
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,440
你是自由身吗
You're free to go wherever you like?

1075
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,800
理查德 你是自由身吗
You're free to go wherever you'd like, Richard?

1076
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,140
- 谁是你同伙 - 那边怎么回事
- Who are you working with? - What happened out there?

1077
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,320
大家在说
What do you think of the appearance

1078
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,650
你是头号嫌犯 你怎么看
that people are saying that you are now the prime suspect?

1079
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,120
理查德 怎么回事
What's going on, Richard?

1080
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,640
- 理查德 - 我不是嫌犯
- Richard - I'm not a suspect.

1081
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,300
为什么联邦调查局要找你谈话
Why are you talking to the FBI?

1082
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,300
朱维尔先生 为什么联邦调查局要找你
Mr. Jewell, what does the FBI want with you?

1083
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,830
可以透露一下吗
Can you give us any more information?

1084
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,200
不好意思 我感觉有记者跟着我
Sorry, I think I got some media following me.

1085
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,880
不 那是我们的人 伙计
No. Those are our guys, bud. Those are our guys.

1086
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,890
理查德 朱维尔 33岁

1087
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,820
前执法部门职工
A former law enforcement officer,

1088
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,090
据说
The story goes on to say,

1089
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,760
符合独身炸弹袭击者的侧写
"fits the profile of the lone bomber.

1090
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,860
这份侧写指向
This profile generally includes

1091
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,500
一名失意白人 前警官
A frustrated white man who is a former police officer,

1092
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,740
军人 或想当警察的人
member of the military, or police wannabe

1093
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,240
他想当一个英雄
who seeks to become a hero.

1094
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,100
保安最先通知警察有炸弹
The security guard who first alerted police to the pipe bomb...

1095
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,860
炸弹随后在世纪奥林匹克公园爆炸
That exploded in Centennial Olympic Park."

1096
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,020
那直到情况不对劲为止
So, up until it obviously went sideways,

1097
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,420
一切正常 是吗
Everything pretty normal about that evening, right?

1098
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,520
是的 再寻常不过了
No, it was a regular night from what I could tell.

1099
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,520
大伙玩得很开心
Everyone was having a great time.

1100
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,090
像是场狂欢
It was like a celebration.

1101
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,330
对 没有一丝
Yeah. no air of...

1102
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,190
你玩得正尽兴
Yeah, you were having fun.

1103
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,000
我很开心 很享受
I was having fun. It was a good time.

1104
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,770
但那有几个人
But there was, uh, some guys

1105
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
扔些瓶子或者类似的 对吗
with beer cans or something like that?

1106
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,970
就在塔后面
Guys behind the tower.

1107
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,380
他们在干什么 在扔
What were they doing there? They were throwing...

1108
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,370
啤酒瓶 - 哦对 啤酒瓶
- beer bottles. - beer bottles. yeah.

1109
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,170
他们大吵大闹
They were horsing around, fooling.

1110
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,310
我打断他们并对此劝阻
I broke it up and I gave 'em a talking-to,

1111
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,550
然后他们走了
And they left. Yep.

1112
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,280
这还是在塔后面吧
And that was behind the tower?

1113
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,820
对 长官 - 好
- Yes, sir. - Right.

1114
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,330
接着你绕着塔转了转
So then you came back around the tower

1115
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,090
在那你发现了可疑背包
And that's where you saw the package unattended?

1116
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,920
对 - 嗯好
- Yes, sir. - Right.

1117
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,930
那你发现有人正从凳子那走开吗
And did you see anyone walking away from the bench?

1118
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,290
不 长官 要是发现我会跟上去的
No, sir. I would've tailed them if I did.

1119
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,830
好
Yeah.

1120
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,270
那就是说你不知道是谁弄的炸弹
So, you have no idea who might have put that package there?

1121
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,800
对 长官
No, sir.

1122
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,340
无论罪犯是谁 都逃不过审判
But whoever did, I think they ought to fry.

1123
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,910
对 我们也同意 理查德
Oh. yeah. We think so, too, Richard.

1124
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,180
必然如此
Absolutely.

1125
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,180
这样 我们接下来呢
So, here's what we're gonna do.

1126
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,980
要尽量严肃正经
We're trying to be as authentic as possible

1127
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,050
所以这要求我们得像审犯人一样
And part of that has to do with how you treat a suspect.

1128
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,200
好吗 所以我们要
All right? So, what we're gonna do is

1129
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,820
要假装
We're gonna pretend

1130
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,530
你就是犯罪嫌疑人
that we actually brought you in, in that regard.

1131
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,020
好吗 - 这
- Right? - That...

1132
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,230
我们会宣读你的米兰达权利
And we read you your Miranda rights

1133
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,470
然后你要选择放弃
And you've agreed to waive them.

1134
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,540
哦对了 你还得填个表
In fact, we have a form you can sign.

1135
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,000
对 为什么你不
Yeah. why don't you...?

1136
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,260
就这个
This'll be good.

1137
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,830
看起来更正式点
Just so it looks real.

1138
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,930
嗯 你就在那签个字
Yeah. so, you just sign the bottom there

1139
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,170
我们把它录上
And we'll get that on tape

1140
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,240
然后我们继续采访
And then we'll continue on with the interview.

1141
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,840
好
Okay.

1142
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,850
嗯
Yeah.

1143
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,590
不好意思 理查德 可能我没说明白
I'm sorry, Richard, maybe I wasn't clear.

1144
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,120
你得在上面签字 不是比划一下
You actually have to physically sign the paper.

1145
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,360
这可是个有法律效益的文件 - 噢
- This is a real document. - Well...

1146
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,930
对呀 我们不是要正式嘛 理查德
Of course. we're going for authenticity here, Richard.

1147
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,900
这样看起来才会真呀
It has to be real for the video.

1148
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,340
不好意思 长官 我不
I'm sorry, sir. I don't...

1149
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,540
我不认为我愿意
I don't think I would feel comfortable

1150
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,180
签这种东西
signing something like this.

1151
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,880
理查德 我们只想
Richard, we just want...

1152
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,250
这样吧 我们稍作休息
You know what? Why don't we take a quick break?

1153
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,580
停一下录像 - 好
- Go ahead and stop the camera. - Okay.

1154
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,420
嗯
Um...

1155
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,520
嗯好 - 我俩商量个事
- Yeah. okay. - We'll just talk for a second.

1156
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,560
马上就来 - 很快
- We'll be right back. - Right back.

1157
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
我以前是个副警长
I was a sheriff deputy.

1158
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,270
在哈伯沙姆县干的
Habersham county.

1159
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,270
好了 理查德
All right, Richard,

1160
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,150
我们就当这一切都没发生过
We're gonna pretend like none of that ever happened.

1161
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,640
重新开始 好吗
Let's get a new tape going. okay?

1162
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,980
嗯
Uh...

1163
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,580
接下来呢
What we're gonna do now...

1164
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,210

There you go. I got it.

1165
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,220

Get her out there and we'll throw it away.

1166
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,190

他重新介绍下自己
He's gonna reintroduce himself,

1169
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,930
像正式采访一样向你出示证件
Show you his credentials just like a professional interview

1170
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,190
紧接着
And then we're gonna

00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,270
我们会宣读你的米兰达权利
Actually read you your Miranda rights.

1172
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,660
为什么读这个
Why would he do that?

1173
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,270
为了更显正式呀 理查德
Well, to make it more authentic, Richard.

1174
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,330
越正式越好
We want this to look as authentic as possible.

1179
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,380
我有必要联系我的律师
I think maybe I should contact my attorney.

1180
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,630
为什么突然要联系他呢 理查德
Now, why would you wanna do that, Richard?

1181
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,420
我是说
I mean...

00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,020
你不是英雄吗
You're the hero, right?

1183

We're having some trouble

1282
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,560
联系不上布莱恩 斯科特

1292
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,710
按FBI的话说 他们已经要立案侦查了

可能已经有足以逮捕他的证据了

1295

案件目前仍有疑点

Did you do this?

1367
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,040
当然不
No.

1368
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,970
你刚刚是怀疑我吗
Are you asking if I did it?

1369
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,170
我是在询问你
I'm asking you if you had any part

1370
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,040
你参加过世纪公园的爆炸行动吗
of the centennial bombing, yes.

1371
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:37,610
所以 你要是有任何
So, if you had anything to do with this,

1372
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,780
参加过任何部分
had any part in this...

1373
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,720
我没有
I didn't...

1374
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:44,550
我没有放炸弹
I did not plant that bomb in centennial park

1375
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,590
而且我以为你知道这个 是我错了
And I made the mistake of assuming you knew that.

1376
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,960
好吧 那
All right, well, let's beat

1377
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,760
让我们一起打败那些垃圾们吧
The hell out of these bastards.

1378
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,170
好吗
Okay?

1379
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,970
你是他的律师吗
Are you his attorney?

1380
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,720
你和理查德 朱维尔的关系是什么
What is your relationship with Richard Jewell?

1381
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,860
要是FBI不调查他的话
I think the FBI would be derelict

1382
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:22,090
这会是FBI的失职的
not to investigate Richard Jewell.

1383
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,790
他们只是完成自己的工作而已
They're just doing their jobs.

1384
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,140
你什么时候会再和他见面
When are you meeting with him again?

1385
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,700
不 他们职责所在而已
No, they're just doing their job.

1386
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,630
为了确保万无一失
They're just making sure no rock is unturned.

1387
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,110
你一会还是和他见面吗
Are you gonna meet with him again soon?

1388
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,800
不好意思
Excuse me.

1389
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:35,300
是的 我和理查德已经是十年老友了
Yes. I've been friends with Richard for 10 years.

1390
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,210
你是他的律师吗 - 对
- Are you his lawyer? - I am.

1391
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,840
是他安的炸弹吗
Did he set that bomb?

1392
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,080
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

1393
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,980
你会为他辩护吗
You'll be defending him?

1394
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,210
有可能
Possibly.

1395
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:53,720
不是真正的法律身份吧 布莱恩特先生
Not quite real estate law, is it, Mr. Bryant?

1396
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,030
哇哦 我的天
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

1397
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,590
你他妈的是谁
Who the hell are you?

1398
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,070
我会是你最好的战友
I could be the best friend you'll ever have.

1399
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,770
凯西 斯克鲁格斯 是亚特兰大宪报的
Kathy Scruggs. AJC.

1400
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,970
你说是就是
Of course you are.

1401
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,330
听着 - 下车
- Listen... - Get out.

1402
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,640
你真的为理查德朱维尔
Have you secured an actual

1403
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,880
做辩护律师了吗
defense attorney for Richard yet?

1404
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,610
无可奉告
No comment.

1405
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,810
赶紧下车
Get out of the car.

1406
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,880
你看啊 无可奉告是不能帮你的
See, "no comment" doesn't help me,

1407
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,280
也就是说我帮不了你
which means I can't help you.

1408
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,620
这就是你想做的吗 你想帮我吗
Is that what you wanna do? You wanna help me?

1409
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,080
沃森 我看你可能
Watson, I don't get the sense you

1410
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,690
没有注意到你现在的危险处境
grasp the tank that's about to roll over you.

1411
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,160
我们说的可是美国政府
We're talking about the U.S. government here

1412
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,920
他们在调查恐怖袭击案
investigating a terrorism act.

1413
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,690
你需要我
You need me.

1414
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,990
听着 疯丫头 你想让我叫警察吗
Okay, listen, crazy lady, you want me to call the cops?

1415
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,630
噢那可真是太好了
Oh, please do.

1416
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,600
警察喜欢我的 我经常给他们讲故事
The cops love me. I tell their stories all day.

1417
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,930
不如说说你的吧
Let me tell yours.

1418
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,730
我只会问
I'm just gonna ask

1419
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,280
几个能帮叙述你故事的小问题
A couple questions that'll help you tell your story.

1420
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,740
并且你需要我来 - 赶紧下车
- And you need me to help... - Get out. Get out of my...

1421
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,050
你是真的有种 - 那可不
- You got some balls, man. - Yes, I do.

1422
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:42,370
滚出去
Get out.

1423
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,950
别啊 就只问几个小问题
Come on. I'll just ask you a few questions.

1424
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,640
滚吧 - 我们可以一起下车的
- Get out. - We can go together.

1425
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,840
来吧 我带了笔记本的
Come on. I'll get my notepad.

1426
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,280
给老子快他妈的下车
Get the fuck out of my car now!

1427
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,110
从车里滚出去
Get out of my car!

1428
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:51,780
我受够了
I'm sick of this shit.

1429
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,320
你知道从哪找我
You know where to find me.

1430
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,730
别担心 - 我从来没上过电视还
- Yeah. Don't worry. - Never been on TV before.

1431
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,160
没事的
You'll be fine.

1432
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,900
朱维尔的律师 布莱恩特先生
Mr. Jewell's attorney, Mr. Bryant.

1433
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,140
感谢到访 - 不客气
- Thanks for coming in. - You're welcome.

1434
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,700
关于调查你的委托人这件事
What are the authorities telling you

1435
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,150
当局有跟你说些什么吗
about their suspicions about your client?

1436
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,200
没有
Uh, nothing.

1437
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,670
什么也没有吗
No communication whatsoever?

1438
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,880
他们只告诉我
Uh, all they've said to me is that

1439
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,210
不会逮捕他而已
They're not going to arrest him.

1440
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,780
这是他们昨天说的原话
That's what they told me yesterday.

1441
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,110
你信吗
You believe that?

1442
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,380
显然不
No.

1443
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:26,860
那你就是觉得他会被逮捕
You think they are going to arrest him?

1444
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,250
我觉得他们不会告诉我
I don't think they'd tell me

1445
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,990
是否会逮捕他 就这样
Whether they were or they weren't. That's all.

1446
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,350
你认为FBI在调查过程中
What do you think of the manner

1447
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,220
对待你的委托人的方式
In which the FBI has treated your client

1448
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,660
是否不妥 - 我认为那个
- pursuing this investigation? - I think whoever the bum was

1449
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,960
将理查德朱维尔引上
that leaked that Richard Jewell

1450
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,690
风口浪尖的坏蛋
Was the focus of this investigation,

1451
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,660
他才应当被起诉
He deserves to be prosecuted

1452
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,030
或者用别的方法来惩罚
or dealt with in some serious way.

1453
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,430
我不认为调查过程
I don't think that this investigation

1454
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:48,070
应该曝光在世界关注之下
should be conducted under world spotlight,

1455
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,700
如果你愿意像目前一样
If you will, like this.

1456
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,450
关于今天被搜查的小屋一事
What's your client told you about this cabin

1457
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,110
你的委托人如何告知你的
that's being searched today?

1458
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,390
据我所知那是他以前的住所
It's his former residence, as I understand it.

1459
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,150
有些事你得明白
You need to understand something.

1460
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:00,050
自从前天晚上
I have barely had the time to take a breath in this case

1461
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,050
我几乎没有休息时间
since it started the other night.

1462
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,160
我们得应对媒体 FBI
We have been reacting to the media, to the FBI,

1463
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,060
我甚至没有准备好
and I have not sat down

1464
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,390
这次深入访谈中
and conducted an in-depth interview

1465
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:13,930
你们问我的相关问题
about all these things that y'all are asking me about.

1466
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,770
那你为什么如此确信他是无辜的呢
Then why are you so convinced of his innocence?

1467
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,430
因为我认识他有段时日了
Because I've known Richard for a while.

1468
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,080
我还看他的眼睛问他是否是罪魁祸首
I've looked him in the eye and I've asked him the question.

1469
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,370
但是你得承认
But you've admitted to me,

1470
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,870
你甚至都不知道他还有个小屋
You didn't even know he had a cabin.

1471
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,350
你也不了解他先前的逮捕
You didn't know about this prior arrest.

1472
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,120
也不知晓他先前的劣习
You didn't know about the prior misdemeanors.

1473
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,050
他有很多你不知道的事
There's a whole lot of priors you didn't know about.

1474
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,380
我没有完整了解过
I have not conducted a thorough investigation

1475
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,810
理查德的过去 - 当然 这我明白
- into Richard's history. - No, I understand all that.

1476
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,080
我想我问的是
I guess what I'm asking you is

1477
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,820
既然你没有调查过他
considering that you haven't done that,

1478
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,230
他又有很多你不知道的事情
and considering there are things that you didn't know,

1479
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,730
为什么你还觉得他是清白的呢
why are you so convinced of his innocence?

1480
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,820
因为我相信他
Because I believe him.

1481
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,950
就这么简明扼要吗
Plain and simple?

1482
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,860
对 没错
Yeah. that's right.

1483
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,330
有很多人
I don't know a whole lot of things

1484
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,190
关于他们我也不了解呀
About a whole lot of people that I know.

1485
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:48,730
我没有理查德的在警记录
I don't have Richard's police records. You may. I don't...

1486
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,970
我也不急着完成什么指标 这就是全部了
I have not gotten up to speed on some things. That's all.

1487
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,170
但我不知道这些事情
But just because I don't know these things

1488
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,310
并不意味着
doesn't mean that I don't have a feel

1489
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,510
我不能从理查德的角度出发来思考
for where I think Richard is in this case.

1490
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,490
那你知道哈伯沙姆警局
Were you aware that the habersham sheriff's department

1491
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:05,210
曾要求他去做心理咨询吗
had asked him to seek psychological counseling?

1492
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,950
这我也不清楚
I don't know that either.

1493
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,250
但是我知道许多人
But I know a lot of people

1494
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,090
都得去做心理咨询
who ought to have psychological counseling.

1495
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,320
沃森 布莱恩特 感谢您的到来
Watson Bryant, I thank you very much.

1496
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:13,920
谢谢 再见

First of all,

1499
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,430
我们要向公众保证
We wanna reassure the public that

1500
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,170
尽管昨日发生了如此惨剧
Atlanta is a safe place...

1501
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,000
但是亚特兰大依旧是一个安全的地方
In spite of the tragedy of last evening.

1502
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,330
喂
Hello?

1503
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,540
你曾因为冒充警察
Were you arrested

1504
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,370
而被逮捕过吗
for impersonating an officer?

1505
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,040
是啊有过一次
Yeah, once.

1506
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,880
- 当时情况很复杂 - 当时
- It was complicated. - It was...

1507
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,540
你有打算告诉我吗
Were you planning on telling me?

1508
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,080
当然了我只是
Yeah, of course. I just...

1509
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,050
昨天吹上天了给忘了
In all the hoopla yesterday, I guess I just forgot.

1510
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,320
我的老天爷啊
Jesus Christ! What the...

1511
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,390
还有什么东西你忘记了吗
Was there anything else that you forgot?

1512
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,790
因为刚刚我在今日节目里面
'Cause I just had my ass handed to me

1513
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,460
可倒了大霉了
On the fucking today show!

1514
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,090
谢谢您嘞
Thanks a lot.

1515
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,800
真是好消息呢

01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,670
公司意味着有合伙人
Firms mean partners,

1667
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,940
合伙人认为他们可以对你指手画脚
And partners think they can tell you who to be.

1668
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,840
我不太喜欢被人说教
I don't care much for being dictated to.

1669

嘿！你没有权力这么做

1670
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,650
- 回来 - 妈妈 怎么了

1671
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,950
他们拿走了我的内衣
They went through my underthings.

1672
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,850
他们还想要我们受多少的侮辱
How much indignity do they want us to take?

1673
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,020
波比
All right, Bobi.

1674
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,220

1678
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,800
他们拿走了你什么东西
What did they take from you?

1679
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,400
等一下 等一下
Hold on now. Hold on.

1680
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,800
波比 让我来帮你处理这件事
Bobi, let me take care of it for you.

1681
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,570
我能来你帮你处理吗
Can I take care of it for you?

1682
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,740
我会拿回来的
I'm gonna go get 'em.

1683
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,440
我会拿回来的 等一下
I'm gonna go get 'em. Excuse me.

1684
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,230
你能告诉我们什么消息吗
What can you share with us?

1685
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,770
显然他们发现了
They found

1686
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,680
一些非常危险的连裤袜
Some really dangerous pantyhose, apparently.

1687
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:55,440

What can I help with?

1692
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,040
先进来吧 一会儿就好
Just come on inside. Just for a second.

1693
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,330
他们从房子里拿走了什么
What did they pull out of the house?

1694
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,690
是他做的吗 沃森
Did he do it, Watson?

1695
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:13,330
不他没有
No, he did not.

1696
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,970
理查德朱维尔是一个无辜的人 他是个英雄
Richard Jewell is an innocent man. He's a hero.

1697
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,900
如果他是无辜的话为什么联邦调查局在这里
If he's innocent, then why is the FBI here?

1698
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:22,370
我们欢迎联邦调查局 我们很高兴他们来了
We welcome the FBI. We're glad they're here.

你知道我说的是实话 凯西
You know that's not true, Kathy.

1701
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,050
我能看看那些盒子吗
Can I see those boxes, please?

1702
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,750
好吧 接下来呢
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

1703
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,030
我会把电话给你
I'm gonna hand you this phone...

1704
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,450

01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:39,730
你要等到哔哔声
You're gonna wait till the beep

1706
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,420
然后你要对着电话说
And then you're gonna say into it,

1707
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,460
在世纪公园有一个炸弹

01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,030
我觉得那天晚上值得纪念
I think it was a pretty memorable night

1816
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,870
因为我做了了不起的事
where I did something pretty great.

1817
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:02,370
所以我觉得这值得保存
So, I thought maybe that was worth holding on to.

1818
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,140
好吧
Wow. Okay.

1819
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,170

1821
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:20,290
他们现在想取走你的头发和手印
They want your hair now, and your palm prints.

1822
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,360
祝你愉快

1823
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:25,760
进来吧
Come in.

1824
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,500
拔下来25根 收起来25根
25 pulled, 25 collected.

1825
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,940
告诉你 哪怕你有搜查令
I tell you, you might have a warrant for this,

1826
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:38,270
但如果你这么对我
But if you were to do this to me,

1827
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:39,940
我一定会揍你
You'd have to fight me. Oh!

1828
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:42,410
揍得你满地找牙那种
You'd have to beat the shit outta me!

1829
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,080
你这个律师不是很像律师啊
Not very lawyerly of you, counselor.

1830
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,910
好吧
Yeah, well...

1831
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:47,960
我们能不能在我妈妈回家之前弄完
Can we just get this over with before my mama comes back?

1832
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,750
我不想让她看到这些
I'd like her not to see this.

1833
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,360
告诉我 理查德
Tell me, Richard,

1834
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:02,500
你仍然以执法为傲吗
You still proud to be law enforcement?

1835
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:06,400
你知道吗 或许我可以做的更好一点
You know what? Maybe if I did my job a little better,

1836
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,500
人们就可以离得足够远
And got people far enough away,

1837
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,840
那我现在就不会坐在这里了
Then I wouldn't be sittin' here right now.

1838
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,140
好吧 他真是个奇葩 伙计们做的不错啊
Yeah, he's a real monster. Boy, you guys nailed it.

1839
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,850
你们这些笨蛋还没计算
Have you dummies done the math yet

1840
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,550
到公用电话的距离吗
on the call from the pay phone?

1841
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,350
听着 去他的公用电话
Hey, listen, fuck the pay phone! Okay?

1842
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,990
我的客户那天晚上在公园
My clients were the people in the park that night

1843
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,560
他们的头不该被炸飞的
That didn't deserve to get their fuckin' heads blown off.

1844
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,330
你知道吗 我为你们这些家伙感到抱歉
You know, I actually feel sorry for you guys.

1845
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,460
一旦真的炸弹犯再出动
When the real bomber does it again,

1846
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:35,560
全国都会问 FBI在哪里
And the country asks, "where was the FBI?"

1847
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,170
你们就会说 我们当时忙着
You're gonna say, "we were busy

1848
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,510
给理查德 朱维尔取样头发呢
Getting hair samples from Richard Jewell."

1849
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:41,000
-我这里好了 -都好了吗 很好

1850
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,300

谢谢你的专业的考虑
for your professional consideration.

1853
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,340
你懂得 警察之间那种
You know, cop to cop.

1854
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,310
我们是FBI
"we're the FBI."

1855
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,810
我懂了你的警察之间 在这
I got your cop to cop. Right here.

Found it. Thank you.

1858
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,950
理查德 我们需要对这些混蛋
Richard, we need to be a little less, uh...

1859
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,260
少一点关怀
solicitous and a little more

1860
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:05,860
多一些愤怒
righteous with these assjacks.

1861
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:09,430
我是觉得 只是头发 还会长回来的
I mean, it's just hairs. They'll grow back. It's fine.

1862
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,530
你说什么
What'd you say?

1863
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,470
只是头发 还会长
They're just hairs. They'll grow back.

1864
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,840
只是头发 兄弟
They're just hair. Hey!

1865
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,080
你为什么不像我一样生气呢
Why doesn't this shit make you as angry as it makes me?

1866
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:22,440
我很生气
I am angry.

1867
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,280
你别骗我了
You could have fooled me.

1868
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:26,080
你生气吗
You're angry?

1869
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:28,850
当然
'Course I am.

1870
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,180
我都不知道生气这个词
I don't know if "angry"

1871
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,950
是否可以表达我的愤怒
is even a big enough word for how I feel.

1872
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:35,490
来吧
Come on.

1873
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,360
那就不要像门垫似的了
Then stop being such a doormat.

1874
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,090
不要当他们的好朋友了
Stop trying to be their best friend.

1875
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:40,470
你知道吗 他们在外面嘲笑你 你知道
You know, they're making fun of you out there. You know

1876
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,130
- 他们怎么称呼你吗 -我知道的
- what they're calling you? - I know that!

1877
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,030
我知道他说的警察之间是什么意思
I know what it means when he says "cop to cop."

1878
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,870
他当然不是那个意思
He doesn't mean cop to cop.

1879
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,040
他觉得我是面团宝宝
He thinks I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy.

1880
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:49,370
你真的知道吗 别骗我了
Do ya? could have fooled me.

1881
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,910
我以为你俩订婚了呢
I thought you guys were gonna get engaged.

1882
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:55,110
理查德 你要是现在吃饼干
Hey! Richard! You go for a cookie right now,

1883
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,550
我就把你手剁下来塞进屁股里
I'm gonna chop off your hands and shove 'em up your ass!

1884
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,950
你吃个饼干试试看 混蛋
Try eating a cookie then, fucker.

1885
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,290
你为什么要当我的律师
Why'd you wanna represent me and be my lawyer?

1886
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,520
你看上去好像需要帮助
Hey, you looked like you needed some help.

1887
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:11,660
你看起来像是需要卖书赚钱
You look like you might've needed money from a book deal.

1888
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,330
那我问你 你为什么选我
Well, let me ask you, why'd you pick me?

1889
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,440
电话簿上律师有很多
There's a lot of lawyers in the phone book.

1890
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,030
你为什么选了我
What'd you pick me for?

1891
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,440
我选你是因为你是唯一一个
I picked you because you were the only one

1892
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,300
在美国小企业管理局
at the U.S. small business admin bureau

1893
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,670
没把我当五岁孩子的人 没叫我
who didn't treat me like a 5-year-old, and call me

1894
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:25,140
零食袋 飞艇 米其林人
"bag of snacks" and "blimp," "michelin man,"

1895
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:26,410
还有面团宝宝
And "Pillsbury Doughboy."

1896
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,240
你是唯一
You're the only one who treated me

1897
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,310
把我当人看的
like a human being!

1898
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,010
你现在冲我大喊大叫
And now you're just yelling at me,

1899
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:34,950
让我去成为别人
telling me to be somebody that I'm not!

1900
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,650
我不知道怎么成那个样
I don't know how to be that guy!

1901
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,890
你才是那样的 不是我
You're that guy! I'm me!

1902
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,400
什么
What?

1903
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,480
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1904
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,050
我的天
Oh, my lord.

1905
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,320
他们怎么可以这样
How can they do that?

1906
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:11,320
很简单
It's easy,

1907
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,990
因为你不介意
Because you don't matter.

1908
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,360
所以才这样
That's how come.

1909
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:32,010
我们要离开
We need to go!

1910
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:35,280
你们快走
Move!

1911
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:40,520
你们必须走
You guys gotta go!

1912
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:48,490
我们需要疏散
We need to evacuate!

1913
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,480
杜契斯先生
Mr. Dutchess.

1914
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
有空吗
You got a minute?

1915
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,090
有
I got that.

1916
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:54,390
走吧
There you go.

1917
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,120
-我能吃完饭吗 -不能
- Can I finish my food? - Nope. mmm.

1918
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,060
好吧
Hmm, that's good.

1919
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,570
他们认为
They've decided that since

1920
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,440
你不可能自己给911打电话
you can't have placed the 911 call yourself,

1921
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,840
所以你必须有个同伙
That you must've had a partner.

1922
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:15,610
他们觉得你的同伙就是你的同性恋男友
They think your partner must be your homosexual boyfriend,

1923
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,610
他们觉得可能是我
which they decided is probably me.

1924
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:21,420
什么
What?

1925
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:23,790
他们让我带上监听器
They asked me to wear a wire.

1926
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,190
我让他们滚蛋 我说你是个英雄
I told them to shove it. I said you were a hero.

1927
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,870
他们说 如果他真的是英雄
And they said, "well, if he really is a hero,

1928
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,290
那他没什么好担心的
then he's got nothing to worry about

1929
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:34,660
你也不用担心了
and neither do you."

1930
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:38,370
他们还告诉我 你有个佐治亚州调查局的兄弟
They also told me that, uh, one of your GBI buddies,

1931
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,810
就是过来的时候
you know, the one you made lasagna for

1932
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:40,870
你做了千层面那个
when he came over...

1933
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,170
是 米勒
Yeah, Miller.

1934
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,370
好吧
Yeah.

1935
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,710
他也带了监听器
He was wearing a wire, too.

1936
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:49,780
他从你这录了不少
He's got a lot on you.

1937
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,620
还有一件事
There's, uh, one other thing. um...

1938
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,890
他们问我有没有造管制炸弹的经验
They asked me if I'd ever had any experience with pipe bombs

1939
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,090
我只能实话说了
And I had to tell them the truth.

1940
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,700
你知道吗 那种小的
You know, the little ones.

1941
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,740
我小时候在弗吉尼亚西部
We used to drop them down gopher holes when I was a kid

1942
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:14,800
-常常扔进地鼠洞 - 天哪 大卫
- in west Virginia. - David... lord.

1943
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,840
我告诉他们这之后几年我才认识的理查德
I told them this was years before I even met Richard.

1944
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:20,370
我说了好几次
I told them a couple times.

1945
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,480
还是
Still...

1946
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:25,310
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1947
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,850
只是
It's...

1948
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,450

我做的
I did what was...

1953
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:49,370
关
Hey. hey, turn...

1954
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:53,170
你在干什么
Come on! What are you doing?

1955
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:56,610
我们不能在他们监听的时候
We can't be watching movies with bombs and explosions

1956
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,850
看有炸弹和爆炸的电影
when they're listening.

1957
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,350
来
Come...

1958
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,530

我只是想做正确的事
I'm... I'm trying to do the right thing.

1960
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,700
对吗
Right?

1961
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:19,200
伙计们 他们没有在监听吗
Guys... are they not listening?

1962
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,440
妈妈 很抱歉
Hey, mama, I'm sorry.

1963
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:35,250

Mama, I'm sorry.

妈妈出来吧
Mama, come on out.

骄傲了三天
to be proud of her son,

1990
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,540
然后就被他们毁了
and then taken away from her.

1991
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,470
这是不对的
Yep. That ain't right.

1992

你是来自首的吗
Are you here to turn yourself in?

1997
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:56,860
不知道为什么不让FBI做这个
Don't see why we can't just let the FBI do this.

1998
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:59,660
你相信他们的结果吗
Uh, you trust them with the results?

1999
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:02,060
放心就好 深呼吸
You're in good hands here. Just breathe.

你好
Hey.

2026
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,940

-这是理查德 朱维尔 -你好

这是顶级科幻小说

01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:29,620
炸弹嫌疑犯渴望成为焦点
"bomb suspect sought limelight."

2034
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:31,150
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

2035
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,720
你以为你是谁啊
Who the hell do you think you are?

2036
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,620
布莱恩特先生 我只是在报道事实
Mr. Bryant, what I do is I report the facts.

2037
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:35,730
你是在引导大众
You lead the public, is what you do.

2038
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,790
我报道的是事实
I report the facts.

-怎么得到这份工作的 -没错
- How'd I get this job? - Yeah.

2045
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,880
布莱恩特先生 如果你有问题可以向FBI提
Mr. Bryant, if you have an issue, you can take it up

2046
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,010
是他们在调查你的客户
with the FBI for investigating your client.

2047
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,500
胡说八道
Oh, bullshit.

2048
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:51,710
与我无关好吗
It has nothing to do with me. All right?

2049
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,240
我只是听到了事实
What I do is, I hear the facts,

2050
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:54,780
报道了事实 这是我的责任所在

我的原则就是要报道事实
My guiding principle is to report the facts.

2053
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:59,910
什么狗屁原则
What fucking principles?

2054
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,780
你应该遵守的原则现在就站在我旁边
This isn't a principle standing next to me.

2055
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,050
去你的原则吧
Fuck your principle.

2056
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,650
这个人他叫理查德 朱维尔
This man's name is Richard Jewell.

2057
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,190
他救人性命 他是个英雄
He's a hero. He saved lives.

2058
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,660
你闯进来 跟我说这些 简直是不可理喻
You're unbelievable, just coming in here.

2059
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:09,030
我不可理喻 你有没有搞错
I'm unbelievable? Do you have any idea

2060
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,660
你明不明白你到底做了些什么
what kinda wildfire you started?

2061
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:14,090
你毁了这个人的一切
You've ruined this man's life.

2062
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:16,040
- 也许你欠他一句道歉 - 听着
- Maybe you owe him an apology. - Listen...

2063
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,100
你看这样如何
How about that?

2064
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:18,830
朱维尔 呃 先生 我
Mr... Mr. Jewell, I...

2065
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,630
你知道你就是个 什么
You know, you are a... what?

2066
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:22,100
我说 对于你和你的母亲所经历的这一切
I said I'm sorry

2067
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,750
我感到抱歉
for what you and your mother have gone through.

2068
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:26,170
得了吧 你就是新闻工作者里的败类
Oh, you are a miserable excuse for a journalist.

2069
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:28,040
- 你就是个蛀虫 - 你知道吗
- You're a parasite. - You know what...

2070
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:30,910
为了篇该死的报道不择手段
anything to sell a goddamn paper, you know that?

2071
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:33,050
你简直是在无事生非
Why don't you go chase another ambulance?

2072
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,980
去你妈的
Kiss my ass.

2073
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,030
- 他简直疯了 - 是啊 所以大家还是抓紧工作吧
- He's out of order. - Y'all can go back to work.

2074
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:42,270
没什么好看的
There's nothing really to watch here.

2075
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:44,090
你们做自己的事情就好了
You can just keep doing your jobs.

2076
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:50,830
哇
Wow.

2077
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:28,700
不是他做的
He didn't do it.

2078
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,970
去他妈的
Oh, fuck.

2079
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,820
你还真有胆量坐在这里啊
You got a lot of fucking nerve sitting here.

2080
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:46,320
朱维尔没有打过那通电话
Jewell couldn't have made the call.

2081
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,060
距离不对
The math is wrong.

2082
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:49,870
我从现场走到电话亭
I covered the distance from the site to the phones.

2083
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:51,650
他不可能来得及打那通电话
There's no way he would have made it in time.

2084
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,630
是的 我们知道
Yeah, we know.

2085
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:57,030
你们知道
You know?

2086
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,570
他有同伙
He had an accomplice.

2087
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:01,340
同伙
An accomplice?

2088
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:03,300
当然 不能有吗
Sure. Why not?

2089
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:06,040
那炸弹袭击者一人独自作案的侧写怎么说
What about the lone bomber profile?

2090
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:08,210
崇拜者模仿警察 还有同伙吗
The wannabe cop? With an accomplice?

2091
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,810
好吧 首先
Well, first of all,

2092
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,050
侧写只是一个初始画像
Profiles are always just a jumping-off point.

2093
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,350
还记得吗 俄克拉荷马城爆炸案就有两个炸弹犯
Oklahoma city had two bombers, if you remember.

2094
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,280
好吧 所以是谁干的呢 同伙是谁呢
Okay, so who did it? Who is it?

2095
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,090
你对我做了这些之后 还觉得我会告诉你吗
Like I'm gonna tell you after the way you burned me.

2096
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,720
好吧
Fine.

2097
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,720
那我就只写对朱维尔不利的案情
I'll just write that the case against Jewell

2098
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,030
已经开始动摇了
is starting to weaken.

2099
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,930
这些糟糕的事实等等 看看事情究竟会如何吧
Bad facts, et cetera. See how that goes.

2100
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,030
你知道吗 我虽然不确定你为什么会这么想
You know what? I'm not sure where you get this idea

2101
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,700
就是我会为你工作 或者说我们合作
That I work for you, or that we work together.

2102
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,200
我甚至不知道我他妈为什么要跟你说话
I don't even know why I'm fucking talking to you.

2103
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,870
我知道 我需要你 你也需要我
I know why. And you need me just as much as I need you.

2104
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,210
你知道吗 亲爱的
You know what, sweetheart?

2105
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,950
你对我来说屁用没有
I don't need you a goddamn bit.

2106
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,990
再来一杯
Can I have one more, please?

2107
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:04,330
我旁边这位是波比 朱维尔
Next to me is Bobi Jewell...

2108
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,900
理查德 朱维尔的母亲
Mother of Richard Jewell.

2109
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:10,440
或许是造化弄人
By some savage twist of fate,

2110
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:12,310
不实地冠以谋杀和故意伤害的罪名
and falsely accused of murder and mayhem.

2111
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,980
不实地冠以谋杀和故意伤害的罪名
and falsely accused of murder and mayhem.

2112
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,210
起诉她儿子的人
Her son's accusers

2113
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:21,980
正是当今世界最强的两股势力
are two of the most powerful forces in the world today.

2114
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:26,220
美国政府和美国媒体
The united states government and the media.

2115
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,720
在过去的四周
For the past four weeks,

2116
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,920
这些可怕的势力联合在一起
these horrific forces have combined

2117
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:33,190
让她生不如死
to make her daily existence a living hell.

2118
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:35,860
如我所说
As I speak,

2119
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,700
他们仍在剥夺着她的人生
they continue to crush the very life out of her

2120
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,300
伤害着她唯一的儿子
and her only son.

2121
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,400
芭芭拉 朱维尔
I introduce Barbara Jewell,

01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:47,110
世纪公园炸弹袭击的第113位受害者

2123

我叫芭芭拉 朱维尔

2124
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:03,090
我是一名理赔协调员

2125
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:05,390
我在当地的保险公司
with a local insurance agency,

2126
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:08,060
已经工作13年了
and I have worked there for 13 years.

2127
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,830
大概四周前
Approximately four weeks ago,

2128
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,870
奥林匹克公园的炸弹
over 100 people were injured

2129
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:18,110
导致超过100人受伤

2人死亡

我的心与这些受害者及他们的家属同在

2132
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,490
我精疲力竭
I am so very drained.

2133
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,160
我向上天请求 祈祷
I hope and pray to god

2134
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:38,160
希望所有人都能远离这种苦难
that nobody ever has to go through this again.

2135
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,460
我认为在场的所有人
I do not think any of you

2136
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:44,830
都想象不出我们的生活变成什么样了
can even begin to imagine what our lives are like.

2137
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:48,870
在媒体的口中
The media has portrayed my son...

2138
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,270
我的儿子实施了这起犯罪
as the person who has committed this crime.

2139
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:59,480
他们剥夺了我们的一切隐私
They have taken all privacy from us.

2140
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,750
让我们的生活不得安宁
They have taken all peace.

2141
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:07,250
他们监视 并拍下我们做的每一件事
They watch and photograph everything we do.

2142
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,920
正如媒体一样
Like the media,

2143
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:15,230
FBI监视着他的一举一动
The FBI follows his every move

2144
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:18,300
也一直监视着我们的住所
and watches my home constantly.

2145
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,500
凭什么
And why?

2146
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,240
我的儿子
My son...

2147
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,080
我的儿子何其无辜

理查德不是奥林匹克公园的炸弹犯

理查德不是一个谋杀犯

2150
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:49,130
他救了这些人的性命
He saved people's lives.

2151
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:57,570
总统大人 请听我一言 伸出援手
Please hear me, Mr. president, and help me.

2152
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,470
只有你有能力终止这场噩梦
You have the power to end this nightmare.

2153
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:03,510
我的儿子是一个英雄
My son is a hero.

2154
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:08,220
我相信FBI已经知道了
I think the FBI knows that by now.

2155
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:14,290
如果他们打算还我儿子清白
If they do not intend to charge my son,

2156
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,020
请告诉我们
Please tell us.

2157
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:19,060
告诉这个世界

2158
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:21,930

01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,930
我本来不想哭的
I... I didn't mean to cry.

2168
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:28,200
不 这很好 简直不能用好来形容

01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:51,510
好吧 我来告诉你都要做什么
All right, let me tell you how it's gonna go.

2178
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:54,650
他们首先会要求与我见面 约法三章
They're gonna ask to see me first, set the ground rules.

2179
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,680
我必须让他们知道我不是同性恋
I wanna make sure they know I'm not gay.

2180
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:03,190
理查德 我觉得我们有更重要的事情要做
Richard, I think we got bigger fish to fry,

2181
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,030
但是 你会有机会告诉他们这个的
But, uh, you'll get the chance to tell them that.

2182
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:07,360
这点是肯定的
I'm sure.

2183
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:11,300
肖探员
Agent shaw.

2184
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,010
敢不敢去看看他有没有士力架
Dare you to see if he's got any snickers.

2185
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:27,250
有点饿了
Kinda hungry.

01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,120
你知道1001是什么吗 雷达
You know what a 1001 is, Radar?

2187
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:35,320
是的 先生 就是对一个联邦探员撒谎
Yes, sir. It's lying to a federal agent.

这是重罪
It's a felony.

2189
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:39,190
你在这有任何不实之言
You say anything in there that isn't true,

2190
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:40,430
他们会把你丢进监狱
they can put you in jail

2191
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,700
根本都不需要证明你是个炸弹犯
without ever proving you're a bomber.

2192
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:43,730
嘿
Hey.

2193
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,400
不知道说什么的时候 就什么都别说
You don't know what to say, you say nothing.

2194
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,710
你可以要求休息5分钟
You ask for a five-minute break,

2195
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:49,570
你可以问我
You consult with me.

2196
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,640
你不要即兴发挥
You do not improvise.

2197
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:52,770
懂了吗
You got that?

2198
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,740
懂了
Yes, sir.

2199
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:57,840
那如果你不知道该说什么 怎么办
So if you don't know what to say, what do you do?

2200
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,680
- 屁都不放一个 - 没错
- I don't say a damn thing. - That's right.

2201
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:09,690
布莱恩特先生
Mr. Bryant?

2202
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,770
需要帮助吗
Can I help you?

2203

我就是看看
I was taking a look.

2204

你们打算怎么解决这件事情
How do you guys wanna handle this?

2205
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,230
是这样 我们会问你们一些问题
Well, we're gonna ask you some questions,

2206
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,150
需要你们给出答案
and you're gonna give us some answers.

2207
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:39,350
怎么样
How's that sound?

2208
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:41,690
好的
Okay.

2209
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,190
听起来不错
Sounds good.

2210
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:45,630
我去叫他
I'll go get him.

2211
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:49,160
准备好了吗 伙计
Hey, you ready, boyo?

2212
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,300

我觉得可以了
I think so. Yeah.

2214
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:52,830
不是 我是说准备好
No, I mean ready.

2215
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,480
不要低眉顺眼 逆来顺受
Look at these guys not as suspect to agent,

2216
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,240
要不卑不亢 你与他们是平等的
But as cop to cop.

2217
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:58,250
不用对他们太客气了
Don't give them any more deference than they're due.

2218
01:51:58,270 --> 01:51:59,810
更不要叫他们长官
And don't keep calling them "sir."

2219
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,310
好的 但他们总归代表美国政府
Yeah, well, they're still the United States government.

2220
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,790
不 他们代表不了美国政府
No, they aren't the United States government.

2221
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:06,380
他们就是三个
They're just three pricks

2222
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:07,460
为美国政府工作的混蛋
who work for the United States government.

2223
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,850
你能明白这之间的差别
You understand the difference?

2224
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,890
这里面坐着的人 没有人好过你
Nobody in that room is a better man than you.

2225
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,250
懂吗
You understand?

2226
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,920
来吧
Come on.

2227
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:16,490
你没问题的
You'll be fine.

2228
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:23,830
这儿 就坐这儿
That's it. Sit right there.

2229
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,160
这儿吗
Right here?

2230
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,200

2232
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:39,180
朱维尔先生
Uh, Mr. Jewell,

我们有几个问题

2236
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:47,820
尤其是世纪公园爆炸案
Specifically the bombing in centennial park.

2237
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:56,900
朱维尔先生 你是否发现你自己
Mr. Jewell, you ever find yourself

2238
01:52:56,930 --> 01:53:01,770
进入过一个名叫糖果小贩的糖果乐园的网站
accessing a internet site called Candyman's Candyland

2239
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,910
上面有一些无政府主义者的食谱
regarding the contents of the anarchist cookbook?

2240
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,540
没有
No, I have not.

2241
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:10,310
但你接受警员培训时
But you do have police training

2242
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,950
培训过如何处理爆炸物 对吗
in handling explosives?

2243
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:14,510
这个问题问过了 也回答过了
Asked and answered.

2244
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:16,420
你收集过爆炸管的碎片吗
Did you ever collect any pieces of pipe

2245
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:19,920
在世纪公园的建筑中的
From, uh, the construction of centennial park?

2246
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:22,820
不 我没有
No, I did not.

2247
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:26,360
你记得在公园有和谁说过
Do you remember telling anybody at the park, uh,

2248
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:27,760
现在 抓紧给我拍照吧
"take my picture now,

2249
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:29,930
因为马上我就要出名了
because pretty soon I'm gonna be famous"?

2250
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,530
没有 长官
No, sir.

2251
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,700
真的吗
Really?

2252
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:34,270
你确定
You sure about that?

2253
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,600
百分之百确定
100%.

2254
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,970
那你有没有说过
How about, did you say,

2255
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:41,410
我在去亚特兰大的路上
"I'm on my way to Atlanta.

2256
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,440
外面马上乱成一锅粥了
It's gonna be a mess out there"?

2257
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:46,450
我指的是外面的交通堵塞
I was referring to the traffic jams.

2258
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,380
朱维尔先生
Mr. Jewell,

2259
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:51,520
你为什么特别想驻守在
Why specifically did you want to be stationed

2260
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:54,450
灯光塔附近
at that sound and light tower?

2261
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:57,920
我只是喜欢听音乐
I just liked listening to the music,

2262
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,460
而且 前一天晚上 我把我妈妈带出来了
and, the night before, I got to bring my mama down.

2263
01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:03,830
我们都想听肯尼 罗杰斯的歌
We got to listen to Kenny Rogers.

2264
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:07,030
她很喜欢 很好听
She liked that. That was nice.

2265
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:11,000
我想这是一个很有利的位置
And I guess I also get a nice vantage point

2266
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,910
可以看看在场所有的漂亮姑娘
to take a look at all the pretty girls.

2267
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:17,340
毕竟我不是同性恋
I am not a homosexual.

2268
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:20,810
大卫 杜契斯也不是
And neither is David Dutchess.

2269
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:23,420
所以你和大卫 杜契斯并不是恋人关系
So you and David Dutchess are not lovers?

2270
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:24,480
已经回答过了
Asked and answered.

2271
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:28,420
朱维尔先生 你之前说过
Mr. Jewell, you said before

2272
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,860
你在舞台和灯光塔之间
that in your comings and goings back and forth

2273
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:33,890
往返的过程中
from the stage to the tower that you couldn't get, uh,

2274
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:36,630
你无法得到一个准确的时间安排 是否属实
an exact fix on the time. Is that correct?

2275
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:42,500
是的 但你忙起来的时候
Yes, but when you have the runs,

2276
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,600
不好意思 应该说是我忙起来的时候
which I did, excuse me,

2277
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:47,010
根本没有心思去想时间
You're not thinking about what time it is.

2278
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,780
你只能尽力
You're just trying to

2279
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,580
来回奔走
Crab-walk to a bathroom, you know?

2280
01:54:53,610 --> 01:54:55,980
也就是说 你不记得看见那些酗酒者
So you don't remember the exact time

2281
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:57,720
朝灯光塔仍啤酒瓶的
that you saw the drunks

2282
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,650
确切时间了
throwing the beer cans against the tower?

2283
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:00,690
是这样吗
Right?

2284
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,890
不是
No.

2285
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,520
你不记得第一次见到那个背包的
You don't remember the exact time

2286
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,530
确切时间
You first saw the backpack?

2287
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,330
是的
That's correct.

2288
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,000
你之前看到过类似背包吗 朱维尔先生
You ever seen a backpack like that before, Mr. Jewell?

2289
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:13,530
是的 我猜是的
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.

2290
01:55:13,570 --> 01:55:16,340
那你之前看到过这个背包吗 朱维尔先生
You ever see that specific backpack before, Mr. Jewell?

2291
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:18,540
已经答过了 可以跳过吗
Asked and answered. Can we move on?

2292
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:20,910
朱维尔先生
Mr. Jewell,

2293
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:24,480
你是否和大卫 杜契斯或者什么其他人
Did you conspire with David Dutchess or anybody else

2294
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:27,550
合谋在世纪公园放置炸弹
to plant a bomb in centennial park?

2295
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:41,730
没有
No.

2296
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,140
那你他妈是怎么知道
Then how the fuck did you know

2297
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,430
在AT&T 灯光塔的另一边
to be on the other side of that AT&T tower

2298
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:48,030
能使你避开爆炸的伤害
where you knew you'd be protected from the blast?

2299
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:50,640
有一枚炸弹在你驻扎的地方爆炸了
A bomb went off right where you were stationed.

2300
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,810
混乱爆发 人们倒成一片
Chaos erupts. Bodies hit the ground.

2301
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:55,140
警察受伤摔倒在地 见鬼 我就是其中一个
Cops go flying. Hell, I was one of them.

2302
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,080
你却毫发未损
You come out without a goddamn scratch.

2303
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:58,980
这怎么可能 理查德
How does that happen, Richard?

2304
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,920
我能向你们在座所有人提一个问题吗
Can I ask all you fellas a question?

2305
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:10,960
天呐 什么问题
Jesus. What?

2306
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,830
你们发现了任何对我不利的事实吗
Do you have any kind of case against me?

2307
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:21,130
我是说证据
I mean evidence.

2308
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:26,710
比如 在我妈妈用的特百惠上发现了什么蛛丝马迹
Like, any traces of anything on my mama's tupperware?

2309
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:30,840
又或者是在她的公寓发现了
Or did you find any bomb-making materials

2310
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,150
任何制作炸弹的材料
in her apartment?

2311
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,480
又或者你们找到一些
Or did you find some...

2312
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,750
好了嘿
Okay. Hey, hey.

2313
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:36,450
理查德 我们不需要
Richard, we don't need to volunteer...

2314
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,890
不 如果我一定要说些什么的话 这个我一定要说出来
No. I'm gonna say this if I'm gonna say anything.

2315
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:41,650
我进来的时候 看见
I walk in here and I look at...

2316
01:56:41,690 --> 01:56:44,190
你们这窗户上的圆形贴纸
The circle decal on your windows there,

2317
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,930
我就在想
And I'm thinking...

2318
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:50,100
我过去常常认为联邦执法部门
You know, I used to think that federal law enforcement

2319
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:52,470
一个人向往的
was just about the highest calling

2320
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,770
最高境界
a person could aspire to.

2321
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,640
但我不确定我以后还会不会这么认为
And I'm not sure I think that anymore, you know?

2322
01:56:57,670 --> 01:56:59,010
在经历了这些事儿之后
Not after all this.

2323
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:03,940
我在那晚完成我的工作
I did my job that night,

2324
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,550
许多人因此获救
and some people are alive because of that.

2325
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:09,680
但你觉得 下一次
But do you think that the next time

2326
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,720
当有安保人员看到可疑包裹的时候
some security guard sees a suspicious package,

2327
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:15,120
我严重怀疑
that he or she's gonna call it in?

2328
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:18,160
他还会不会打电话
I doubt it.

2329
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:19,600
因为他们要考虑一下
You know? 'Cause they're gonna look at that

2330
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:20,930
然后他们会想
and they're gonna think,

2331
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,730
我不想成为另一个理查德 朱维尔
"I don't wanna be another Richard Jewell.

2332
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,470
所以我还是跑吧
So I'm just gonna run."

2333
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:30,000
这样怎么会让人们更安全
How's that make anybody any safer?

2334
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:35,010
你们可以继续盯着我
Y'all can keep following me around some more

2335
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,210
继续你们现在的工作 我可以忍受
doing what you're doing. I can stand it.

2336
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:40,880
但是我知道你们花在我身上的每一秒钟
But I just know that every second you spend on me

2337
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:42,120
都本该用在
is time that you're not spending

2338
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:43,580
揪出那个真正的犯人
on the real guy who did it,

2339
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,080
就像沃森说的 如果
and it's like Watson said. What...

2340
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:49,190
他再这样的话怎么
What happens when he...

2341
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:54,090
他再这样的话怎么办
What happens when he does it again?

2342
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:08,640
那么 你们想告我什么
So, do you have anything you wanna charge me with?

2343
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:15,980
你们能告吗
Can you?

2344
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:27,790
好
Well.

2345
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:31,000
我想是时候走了
I think it's time to go.

2346
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:03,600
他表现的怎么样
How'd he do?

2347
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:04,660
他做的非常好
He did great.

2348
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:08,940
天哪
God.

2349
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:11,170
唔
Yeah.

2350
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:15,240
进去吧
Go on.

2351
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:32,590
- 嘿 - 两位
- Hey. - Gentlemen.

2352
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:33,930
探员肖
Agent Shaw.

2353
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,660
给你们带了东西
Got something for ya.

2354
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:37,100
这是什么
What's this?

2355
01:59:37,130 --> 01:59:38,330
求婚信
Marriage proposal.

2356
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:40,870
噢
Oh.

2357
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,170
我的幸运日
My lucky day.

2358
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,800
额
Uh...

2359
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,180
好啊
Okay.

2360
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:50,780
这是个好开头
Well, this is a good start.

2361
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:52,010
新闻发布会是什么时候
When's the press conference?

2362
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:53,380
我猜你们会对
I'm assuming you'll be announcing

2363
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:56,220
所有大型新闻机构发布吧 汤姆·布罗考之类的
To all the news outlets, Tom Brokaw and the like.

2364
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:59,150
布莱恩特先生 我说清楚
Mr. Bryant, let me be perfectly clear.

2365
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:01,620
我还是觉得你的客户嫌疑非常大
I still think your client is guilty as hell.

2366
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,960
唔
Hmm?

2367
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,800
祝你愉快
Have a nice day.

2368
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,630
你有权利这么想
Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

2369
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,890
本函建议你们
"This is to advise you

2370
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:25,750
基于证据
That based on the evidence..."

2371
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,220
结束了
It's over.

2372
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:36,060
真的结束了吗
Is it... is it really over,

2373
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:39,790
还是又是他们的圈套
or is this just another one of their things?

2374
02:00:41,690 --> 02:00:43,300
你赢了 结束了
You won. It's over.

2375
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,960

You did good.

2376

噢 我想见 我想见妈妈
Oh, I wanna see... I wanna see mama.

2377
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,170
你想见你妈妈吗
You wanna see your mama?

2378
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,200
嗯
Yeah.

2379
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,140
可以的
We can do that.

2380
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:33,710
这是真的吗
That's real?

2381
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:38,420
上面是这么说的
That's what it says.

2382
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:42,250
不作为
"not considered a target

2383
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,990
联邦刑事调查

2384

天哪 娜德雅怎么样
My god, how's Nadya?

2400
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:53,550
理查德 他们找到他了
They found him, Richard.

2401
02:03:53,590 --> 02:03:54,920
找到谁
Found who?

2402
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:56,420
埃里克•鲁道夫

他供认了世纪公园的爆炸案
